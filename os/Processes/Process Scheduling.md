# Process Scheduling
In [[Multiprogramming]], we have some process running all the time, in order to maximize CPU utilization.
[[Time Sharing]], we switch process so quickly that users can interact with each program while it is running.
For achieving above tasks, we have **Process Scheduler**

**The number of processes currently in memory is known as the degree of multiprogramming**

**I/O Bound Process**: Spends more time doing I/O
**CPU Bound Process**: Spends more time doing computations
